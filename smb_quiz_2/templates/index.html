        Welcome to the 8-Bit Super Mario Bros. Quiz! The quiz consists of thirty randomized questions about all three Super Mario Bros. games from the Nintendo Entertainment System. There are three levels of increasing difficulty, consisting of ten questions each. Below are the cumulative points you'll need after each level in order to advance to the next. Beating Level 3 means you beat the game!

    <table class="pixel-font text-sm text-center">
        <tr>
            <td>Level 1 ....... 3500</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Level 2 ...... 20000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Level 3 ...... 60000</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Because questions are randomized, you'll see different ones if you take the quiz again. Future versions of the quiz will include a leaderboard of the top ten scores. Ready?
